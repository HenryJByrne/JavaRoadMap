# JavaRoadMap
Java coursework on data structures. Involved using a graph data structure to simulate electric cars driving around, the edges representing roads and the vertices
representing locations. Utilized BFS traversal to find the shortest path between two nodes, as well as only using nodes with electric charging stations
